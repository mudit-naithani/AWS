AWS STORAGE SERVICES:

S3: Simple Storgae Service - Object Oriented File System
Pay for what you use
All files uploaded in S3 are treated as objects-- objects stored in buckets--root folder has to be a bucket

ELASTIC BLOCK STORAGE (EBS): Acts as a hard drive for ec2 instances. Cannot be used independently, should be used with ec2 only.
1 ec2 instance - Can be connected to multiple EBS Volumes. Vice-versa not true!
Volumes - EBS storage space
Backup of EBS Volumes are Snapshots.
Whenver we want to take a snapshot, we should stop the instance and then take the snapshot to control data integrity.

HOSTING A WEBPAGE IN EC2:
